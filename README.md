# react-vis-updated

A fork of (react-vis)[https://github.com/uber/react-vis] that has
- a new NPM build that includes all the bug fixes since April 18th (why haven't they made a new build?!)

Changes are minimal, so I encourage you to look at the git history. There you can see that I only added what I said above (and no spyware).
